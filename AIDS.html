		<h1> What is HIV?</h1>
		<p>HIV stands for "Human Immunodeficiency Virus". It is the virus that can lead to "Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome", or AIDS.</p>
		<p>HIV damages a person's body by destroying specific blood cells, called CD4+ T cells, which are crucial to helping the body fight diseases.</p>

		<h2> What is AIDS?</h2>
		<p>AIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.<br>
 <br>
Acquired – means that the disease is not hereditary but develops after birth from contact with a disease-causing agent (in this case, HIV).<br>
 <br>
Immunodeficiency – means that the disease is characterised by a weakening of the immune system.<br>
 <br>
Syndrome – refers to a group of symptoms that indicate or characterise a disease. In the case of AIDS, this can include the development of certain infections and/or cancers, as well as a decrease in the number of certain specific blood cells, called CD4+ T cells, which are crucial to helping the body fight disease.<br>
 <br>
AIDS is the last stage of HIV infection when a person's immune system is severely damaged and has difficulty fighting diseases.</p>

		<h2> STOP AIDS</h2>
		<p>Practise Safer Sex:<br>
        <br>
        Maintain stable and monogamous relationship
 	Be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship and limit your number of sex partners.<br>
   
        </p>
	<p>Avoid substance abuse and sharing of needles:<br>
    <br>
 	Do not inject drugs and always avoid sharing needles with others. If you inject drugs, you should get counselling and treatment to stop or reduce your drug use. If you cannot stop injecting drugs, use a new syringe every time. If you must share needles, please do not forget to use bleach and distilled water to clean the syringe so as to reduce the chance of getting HIV infection.
 	 <p/>
     <p>Universal antenatal HIV testing:<br>
 	 
 	The universal antenatal HIV testing programme has been implemented in Hong Kong since September 2001. HIV screening is now available free-of-charge to all expectant mothers attending the Maternal and Child Health Clinics of the Department of Health and antenatal clinics of the Hospital Authority.<br>
 	 <br>
 	If the infected mother and the new born baby receive early and appropriate treatment such as antiretroviral therapies during pregnancy, labouring and after birth periods, the chance of infecting the baby can be reduced to 1-2%.<p/>
